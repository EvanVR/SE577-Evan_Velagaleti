      <p> <h3>About me: </h3> <br>
      Hi This is Evan Velagaleti, I am a full-time MS Computer Science Student at Drexel. I am from Mumbai, India. I'm passionate about coding, sports, and hiking. I find great satisfaction in writing code that solves complex problems and brings innovative ideas to life. When I'm not immersed in the world of coding, I enjoy staying active by participating in sports such as basketball, soccer, and tennis. I also love exploring the outdoors, whether it's hiking through mountains or strolling through local parks. These activities help me clear my mind, stay energized, and provide me with a sense of adventure. As a computer science student, I'm constantly learning new programming languages, algorithms, and software development practices. I'm excited about the possibilities that technology offers, and I'm eager to apply my skills to make a positive impact on society.</p>
